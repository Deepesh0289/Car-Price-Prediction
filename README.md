# Car Price Prediction

Overview
This project focuses on predicting the prices of cars using machine learning techniques. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately estimate the price of a car based on various features such as make, model, year, mileage, and other relevant factors. The dataset used for training and testing the model is sourced from [provide dataset source].

## Table of Contents
#### Getting Started
Make sure you have the foloowing installed on your system-

- python 
- loblib == 1.3.2
- numpy == 1.24.2
- pandas == 2.0.2
- scikit-learn == 1.3.2
- streamlit == 1.28.0
- xgboost == 2.0.1

You can also get this libraries in requirements.txt

####. Data Collection
- You can get the data set in any online site. I mostly prefered Kaggle.

#### Data Preprocessing
- Preparing the data for predicton

####  Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)
- Plotting some sort of graphs and charts to get a short Overview of the data.

#### Feature Engineering
- In this step we are manage all the categorical column before puting the data int the model.

#### Model Training
- 
7. Model Evaluation
